## Introduction
In this project, we would understand and get hands-on experience with the entire concept of CI/CD from an applications perspective. This would help us to gain real expertise around this idea, it is best to see it in action across different programming languages and from the platform perspective. In this project, we would focus on the application perspective focusing on the language PHP

### What is Continuous Integration?
Continuous integration is a software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a shared repository, such as a Git repository. This is done several times per day to avoid conflicts in the code and to ensure that the codebase remains stable and working. By running automated tests on the code after each merge, teams can catch and fix issues early, which helps to prevent "merge hell" and improve the overall quality of the code. Continuous integration helps teams to collaborate more effectively and deliver higher-quality software faster.
