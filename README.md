## Introduction
In this project, we would understand and get hands-on experience with the entire concept of CI/CD from an applications perspective. This would help us to gain real expertise around this idea, it is best to see it in action across different programming languages and from the platform perspective. In this project, we would focus on the application perspective focusing on the language PHP

### What is Continuous Integration?
Continuous integration is a software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a shared repository, such as a Git repository. This is done several times per day to avoid conflicts in the code and to ensure that the codebase remains stable and working. By running automated tests on the code after each merge, teams can catch and fix issues early, which helps to prevent "merge hell" and improve the overall quality of the code. Continuous integration helps teams to collaborate more effectively and deliver higher-quality software faster.

Note: <b>The CI concept is not only about committing our code. There is a general workflow.</b>

### CI Workflow
The CI workflow is as follows:

- <b>Run tests locally</b>: When you are working on a feature, you should run the tests locally to make sure that your code is working as expected. This is a good practice to follow even if you are not using CI. If you are using CI, you should run the tests locally before you commit your code to the repository. Developers write tests for their code called unit tests, and before they commit their work, they run their tests locally. This practice helps a team to avoid having one developer's work-in-progress code from breaking other developers’ copy of the codebase.

- <b>Compile code in CI</b>: After testing the code locally, you should commit your code to the repository. This is the second step in the CI workflow. The CI server picks up the code and runs the build there. In this project, we would use Jenkins as our CI server. The build happens either periodically or after every commit. The benefit of having a CI server is that it ensures that the code runs in a stable state and is visible to everyone. If the build fails, the CI server notifies the team members. This helps the team to fix the issue quickly.

- <b>Run further tests in CI</b>: Even though tests have been run locally by developers, it is important to run the unit tests on the CI server as well. But, rather than focusing solely on unit tests, other kinds of tests and code analysis can be run using a CI server. These are extremely critical to determining the overall quality of code being developed, how it interacts with other developers’ work, and how vulnerable it is to attacks. A CI server can use different tools for Static Code Analysis, Code Coverage Analysis, Code smells Analysis, and Compliance Analysis. In addition, it can run other types of tests such as Integration and Penetration tests. Other tasks performed by a CI server include the production of code documentation from the source code and facilitating manual quality assurance (QA) testing processes.

- <b>Deploy an artifact from CI</b>: Once the code has been tested and is ready to be deployed, the CI server can deploy the code to the production environment. This is the final step in the CI workflow. The CI server can deploy the code to the production environment automatically or manually. If the code is deployed automatically, the CI server can also perform a rollback if the deployment fails. This is a very important feature of a CI server. If the deployment fails, the CI server can roll back to the previous version of the code. This helps to avoid downtime and ensures that the production environment is always stable. 


On the other hand, is Continuous Delivery which ensures that software checked into the mainline is always ready to be deployed to users. The deployment here is manually triggered after certain QA tasks are passed successfully. There is another CD known as Continuous Deployment which is also about deploying the software to the users, but rather than manual, it makes the entire process fully automated. Thus, Continuous Deployment is just one step ahead in automation than Continuous Delivery.

### Continuous Integration in the Real World
To emphasize a typical CI pipeline further, let us explore the diagram below:
